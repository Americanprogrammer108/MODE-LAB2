What does it mean to study organizational feasibility? What do we
need to consider for each stakeholder identified?

To study the organizational feasibility meant that we have to review the
project before bringing it to the market to be sold. This is based
on this question: If we build it, will they come? (Systems Analysis &
Design, Dennis, Haley Wixom, Tegarden, 2021). Upon doing this, the
revision of the project created by the stakeholder and all the workers
who built it will need to know if the customers on the market will
buy the product, so they can analyze if the product was a success.

For each stakeholder identified, we need to consider the following:

- how this person affects the project in any way
- how they communicate with other members on developing the product
- where the product will be shipped to and;
- to make sure the system functions properly
