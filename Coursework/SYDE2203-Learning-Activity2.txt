The expectations of me working as a team is that you should maintain good teamwork. Everyone has different tasks to make things easier rather than to do all the work by yourself (very stressful!). Even if you don't like someone who is in your group, you should still appreciate having them. We all need to work together in a timely-mannered pace to meet all the requirements and to get it done on-time, so that we can get feedback.

I think students should learn that they cannot make arguments on a project even if they don't like it. It might make the team members feel bad, thinking that they didn't do good. Instead, they should judge how our project looks based on their own view and that they should appreciate our work we have done through the waterfall process.
