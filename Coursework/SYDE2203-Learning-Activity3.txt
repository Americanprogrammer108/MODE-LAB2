The project sponsor has many roles with regard to the project because they need to make sure that the group is doing well. This includes providing direction and guidance for project empowerment, key business strategies, and project initiatives, reviewing changes to the project environment, and evaluating the project's success on completion. This person has a higher level than the project manager but is similar to supporting the group's project through resources and support.

The approval committee on the other hand mainly focuses on the approval of projects. They are in charge of many tasks such as approving the project phases, canceling projects that are not helpful for the business, directing/redirecting projects to complete tasks before moving forward, and enforcing project management planning and execution. The committee is similar to that of a traffic light because they need to review if the project the group has planned out is good to go or not.
