<h1>My Emulator Adventure</h1>

<!-- â€¢	Describe your emulator selection process, installation experience, and testing insights. -->
<p>This emulator adventure was filled with awesomeness and entertainment. Since I have BlueStacks, I do no need to download it; it was downloaded throughout the summer for me to play Retro Bowl, a football game. Before my testing, I tested the PaintPot app provided on the class website.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>Throughout my testing process, I played around the Android simulator for a while. Mainly because I had that experience of using my grandfather's phone that is an HTC. The phone ran on Android Ice Cream Sandwich, which I have on BlueStacks. I faced some features such that it took a long to respond to my actions. I had to close the application to reset it.</p>
<br>
<p>PaintPot was a great app because it lets you draw from three colors: red, blue, and green. Holding it in will draw a point, but clicking the mouse and holding the button will let you draw a line. There is no feature to erase any mistakes, so I closed the application.</p>
<br>

<p>I have installed Starbucks as a second app because I want to explore all the coffee flavors for Fall. You can get the most out of it by signing in to get great rewards and discounts. It is compatible with those who want mobile ordering so they don't have to wait in line to decide what they want.</p>

<h1>Toolbox of the Future</h1>
<p>What if anyone asks you to develop an app on a mobile operating system? Well, the answer to that question could be that you need to research on the best platform you could use to build your own app.</p>
<img src="/../MODE-Lab2/React-Native.png" width="250">
<br>
<p>So I decided to use React Native as my best choice because the application is compatible with developing extremely responsive apps. This is a hybrid application where native and web apps combine. On top of that, it is cost-efficient, saving you money and time from developing the app. Reusable code is also used when developing different apps; you need to know what code to use. </p>
<p> Debugging is simple as connecting your Android or iPhone via USB to your laptop/PC. React Native or Expo Go can use various methods to help your app run smoothly and to troubleshoot any errors. That can be done through testing.</p>
<p>Overall, I like the features React Native has and hopefully I will develop an app that no one has ever seen before.</p>

<p>As of now, I have been developing an app on Flutter and Dart, and testing it out on my Android emulator. Check out my first app <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
